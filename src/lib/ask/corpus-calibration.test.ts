// MIN_SCORE (src/lib/ask/store.svelte.ts = 0.4) was calibrated against this exact SHIPPED corpus size.
// The cosine-score distribution compresses as the corpus grows, so a size change can erode the margin
// between the weakest valid lead and MIN_SCORE and start silently dropping real answers. The eval re-gate
// (content-ops/run-eval.mjs) that re-confirms the margin is manual-only and not
// wired into CI, so this tripwire fails the build on ANY corpus-size change: when it fails, re-run the
// eval, re-confirm the margin holds (or recalibrate MIN_SCORE), THEN bump CALIBRATED_CHUNK_COUNT.
// Re-confirmed 2026-07-04 at the real 2125-chunk corpus: run-eval's MIN_SCORE calibration shows 0.4
// still holds the held-out ranking floor (srcHitRate 0.800 / srcMRR 0.610) - the margin survives the growth.
